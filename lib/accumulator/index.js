// FIXME: implement static accumulator
// FIXME: should API receive all values at once?
// FIXME: API may be able to receive one value at
//   at time if `finalize()` (or maybe just `computeWitness()`)
//   can be run after all values are added using inverse of
//   secret independently (w/o modifying accumulator)
